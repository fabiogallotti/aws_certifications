# Cloud Concepts #

## What is Cloud Computing? ##

It's the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data, rather than on a local server or a personal computer.

## Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing ##

Why go with a Cloud Provider over an On-Premises?

1) **Trade capital expense for variable expense**; no upfront-cost and you Pay On-Demand.

2) **Benefit from massive economies of scale**; costs are shared with other customers.

3) **Stop guessing capacity**; not paying for unused servers, scale up/down depending on the needs.

4) **Increase speed and agility**; launch resources in a few clicks.

5) **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers**; focus on your own customers.

6) **Go global in minutes**; deploy in multiregion with low latency.
