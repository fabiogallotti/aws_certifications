# Cloud Concepts #

## What is Cloud Computing? ##

It's the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data, rather than on a local server or a personal computer.

## Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing ##

Why go with a Cloud Provider over an On-Premises?

1) **Trade capital expense for variable expense**; no upfront-cost and you Pay On-Demand.
2) **Benefit from massive economies of scale**; costs are shared with other customers.
3) **Stop guessing capacity**; not paying for unused servers, scale up/down depending on the needs.
4) **Increase speed and agility**; launch resources in a few clicks.
5) **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers**; focus on your own customers.
6) **Go global in minutes**; deploy in multiregion with low latency.

## Types of Cloud Computing ##

- SaaS = **Software** as a Service, for Customers. The product is run and is managed by the service provider. It works and it's available (Gmail).
- Paas = **Platform** as a Service, for Developers. No need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focus on deployment of the applications. (Elastic Beanstalk)
- IaaS = **Infrastracture** as a Service, for Admins. Provides access to networking features, computers, data storage. Don't worry about IT staff, hardware. (AWS)

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models ##

- **Cloud** = fully cloud. (Dropbox)
- **Hybrid** = using both Cloud and On-Premise. (Banks)
- **On-Premise** = deploying resources on-premises, using virtualisation and resources management tools. (Government)
